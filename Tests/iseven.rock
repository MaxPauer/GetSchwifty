Fear is overwhelming
The dark is everything

Death takes a prisioner
Darkness is ruthlessness
Let my soul be a prisioner
While my soul is stronger than the dark
Let my soul be without fear

Until my soul is as strong as the dark
Let her be with darkness

Return my soul is gone

Listen to your mind
Whisper death taking your mind
