modulo takes x, n
while x is greater than nothing
let x be without n

until x is as great as nothing
let ne be with n

return x is nothing

return modulo taking x, 2

sll takes x, n
if n is nothing

let x be times y
return x

srl takes x, n
if n is nothing
return x

let y be n times 2
let x be over n
turn x down
