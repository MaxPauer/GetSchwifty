Darkness is everlasting
Put darkness into Mordor

One Ring is forged
Let there be One Ring between them

Uruk'hai wants manflesh
Let Sauron be darkness
Let the ring be 1
Let ork be there
While ork is weaker than manflesh
Put Sauron with the ring in power
Let Sauron be the ring
Let the ring be power
Let ork be with Mordor

Send the ring back

The hobbits are taken
Listen to them
Shout Uruk'hai taking the hobbits (to Isengard)
